            <p class="pb-2">Career Counseling is the need of the hour in India today. For ages students have been made to follow the same template of completing education and degrees where the student does not really know anything about the career he or she is choosing until it is too late to change the path they are on. It is not only the education system but our societal set up that also contributes to misfit students in career paths they don't really belong to. No wonder India is producing students who are not industry ready after completing graduation and post graduation degrees.</p>
            <p class="pb-2">The solution? Career guidance and counseling that is readily available. Online career counseling for 11-12th is one such option that students can explore from the comfort of their homes. WIth quality career counseling students can understand their strengths and weaknesses, personality types, career-personality fit and opt for careers right at the outset of their journey.</p>
            <p class="pb-2">This is why career counseling for 11-12th becomes so critical for students. It is during this time that the career decisions about graduate programs and competitive exams are taken albeit without proper knowledge and guidance such as college selection, course choices and competitive exams to aim for. </p>
            <p class="pb-2">We at MentroVert aim to educate students and parents alike about the choices and options available to the students to help them opt for the right path and chalk out long term career goals based on their personalities and career fit.

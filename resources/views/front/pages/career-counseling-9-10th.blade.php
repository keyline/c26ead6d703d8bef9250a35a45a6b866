            <p class="pb-2">Career Counseling is the need of the hour in India today. For ages students have been made to follow the same template of completing education and degrees where the student does not really know anything about the career path he or she is choosing until it is too late to change the path they are on. It is not only the education system but our societal set up that also contributes to misfit students in career paths they don't really belong to.</p>
            <p class="pb-2">One of the best solutions that is now readily available from the comfort of oneâ€™s home nowadays is career counseling. WIth quality career counseling students can understand their strengths and weaknesses and opt for careers right at the outset of their journey.</p>
            <p class="pb-2">This is why career counseling for 9-10th becomes so critical for students. It is during high school that most of the career decisions are taken without proper knowledge and guidance such as stream selection, subject choices and competitive exams to aim for.</p>
            <p class="pb-2">We at MentroVert aim to educate students and parents alike about the choices and options available to the students so that they can opt for the right path and chalk out long term career goals based on their personalities and fit. Our expert mentors provide in depth career guidance starting from 10th to help students begin on the front foot.</p>

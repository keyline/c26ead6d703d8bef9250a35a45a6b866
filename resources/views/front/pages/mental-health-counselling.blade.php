            <p class="pb-2">Mental health is the most ignored aspect of one’s health in India and when it is about students, it becomes all the more important!</p>
            <p class="pb-2">Students are under tremendous stress because of factors such as peer pressure, parental expectations and academic performance pressure etc. It becomes imperative for students to take care of their mental health and well being because it can lead to undesirable outcomes in a number of cases. The lack of support and guidance is one of the most common reasons that leads to students not performing well, losing track of their goals and in some cases even losing their lives.</p>
            <p class="pb-2">Mental health counseling for students is needed now more than ever in a world that constantly demands high standards and performance from students. Mental health counseling with an expert counselor not only can help students cope with exam stress but can also help with their personal issues and equip them to handle every type of issue better.</p>

            <p class="pb-2">Preparing for Board exams is one of the most stressful things students encounter during their career journey and everyone knows the importance of the first encounter with the boards. </p>
            <p class="pb-2">Tenth class board exams set the tone for the next step which is stream selection in 11th standard and competitive exam preparation, hence 10th boards carry that much more significance for a high school student.</p>
            <p class="pb-2">If a student is well prepared with good preparation and proper guidance on what path to take after 10th, the board exams become easier to tackle and instead of becoming a hurdle become a milestone in the career journey of the student.</p>
            <p class="pb-2">With MentorVertâ€™s highly skilled and experienced mentors offering board counseling, mental health counseling, step by step guidance, study plans, data driven insights into the board exam patterns and crash courses for 10th boards, preparing for boards becomes an easy task for students.</p>
